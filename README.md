# OnePace Video Player

Video Player to easily keep track on which episode you are on. You need to have downloaded all of the episodes in some folder and they should only contain numbers as filenames (sequential at best). 

## Features
- Track watching progress
- Auto-play next episode
- Delete watched episodes
- 
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MPV Player
- PyQt6

## Installation
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyqt6 mpv
```
Then you can just run the script. I would suggest creating an alias for the script such that you can run it from anywhere.
